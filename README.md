# Bidiagonalization
This is a review of the Golub-Kahan Bidiagonalization Method, using Householder reflectors, which is a method used in numerous algorithms including LSQR and SVD. The method was developed in 1965 to eliminate problems from ill-conditioned or rank-deficient matrices.

I include a digression on Householder reflectors.
