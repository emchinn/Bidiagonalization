# Bidiagonalization
This is a review of the Golub-Kahan Bidiagonalization Method, using Householder reflectors, which is a method used in numerous algorithms including LSQR and SVD. The method was developed in 1965 by [Gene H Golub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_H._Golub) and [William M Kahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kahan) to eliminate problems from ill-conditioned or rank-deficient matrices.

I include a digression on Householder reflectors...
